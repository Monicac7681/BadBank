# Project Title: The BadBank
Full-stack banking website using the MERN stack

# Description/Motivation: 
To create a website for a traditional bank, we need to consider a complete suite of functionalities, including creating accounts, login, authentication, authorization, front-end UI, a database on the back-end, server, and communicating between the front-end and the back-end. This exercise is an excellent opportunity to understand and utilize the MERN Stack. 

# Installation Guidelines: 
1. Create a new folder and download or fork all the files inside this new folder.
2. Open up the terminal app at this folder
3. Type "npm install" and hit "enter"
4. After npm install has completed, type "node index.js". You should see the terminal shows "Running on port: 3000
Connected successfully to db server"
5. Open up a browser, type "http://localhost:3000" to access the applicaiton
